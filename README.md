# Employee Salary Prediction

This machine learning project predicts employee salaries based on multiple features like experience, education, job role, and location. It uses a simulated dataset and demonstrates the end-to-end ML pipeline using Python.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- *Problem Statement:* Estimate employee salaries using regression techniques.
- *Model Used:* Linear Regression
- *Accuracy (RÂ² Score):* 0.96
- *Tools & Libraries:* Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## ðŸ§  Features Used

- Years of Experience
- Education Level (High School, Bachelors, Masters, PhD)
- Job Role (e.g., Software Engineer, Manager)
- Location (e.g., New York, Austin)

## ðŸ“Š Workflow

1. Data simulation and preprocessing
2. One-hot encoding of categorical variables
3. Train-test split
4. Train Linear Regression model
5. Evaluate with MSE and RÂ²
6. Visualize predictions and feature importances
